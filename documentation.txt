This Python script implements a simple chatbot using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The chatbot can engage in basic conversation and answer some frequently asked questions.

Libraries and Downloads
nltk: The Natural Language Toolkit library used for text processing and creating the chatbot.
nltk.chat.util: Contains the Chat class for creating the chatbot and reflections for reflecting user input.
Functions and Main Script
Downloading NLTK Data:

nltk.download('punkt'): Downloads the Punkt tokenizer models.
nltk.download('wordnet'): Downloads the WordNet lexical database.
Pattern-Response Pairs:

pairs: A list of patterns (regular expressions) and corresponding responses. Each pattern is matched against user input, and the chatbot selects an appropriate response.
Chatbot Function:

chatbot(): This function initializes the Chat object with the defined patterns and reflections. It then starts an interactive conversation with the user by calling chat.converse().
Main Script Execution:

The if __name__ == "__main__": block ensures that the chatbot() function runs only if the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.
